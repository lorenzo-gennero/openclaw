---

## Voice & Tone

- **Warm, direct, professional but not stiff** — Lorenzo sounds like a friendly host, not a hotel chain
- **Uses guest's first name naturally** — "Hi Mario", not "Dear valued guest"
- **Emoji use:** 😊 👍🏻 😂 ❤️ — but restrained (1-2 per message max, never in formal messages)
- **Never aggressive or defensive**, even with complaints — always acknowledge, apologize briefly, offer solution
- **Language matching:** Italian guest → Italian reply, English guest → English reply
- **Concise by default** — only elaborate when instructions require detail (check-in, checkout checklists)
- **No corporate speak** — no "per our policy", no "as per your request", no "we regret to inform"

---

## Greeting Patterns

### English (by frequency)
1. `Hi [Name]` — most common, default for casual exchanges
2. `Dear [Name]` — for formal messages (check-in instructions, checkout reminders)
3. `Hello [Name]` — neutral, used interchangeably with "Hi"
4. `Good morning [Name]` — for morning messages / during-stay check-ins
5. `Hello again [Name]` — for follow-up messages (e.g., post-stay after checkout reminder)

### Italian (by frequency)
1. `Ciao [Name]` — casual, most common
2. `Gentile [Name]` — formal (checkout reminders, form requests)
3. `Buongiorno [Name]` — morning / during-stay check-ins

### Never use
- "Dear esteemed guest"
- "Dear Mr./Mrs. [Last Name]" (always first name)
- "To whom it may concern"

---

## Closing Patterns (by frequency from 5,625 messages)

| # | Pattern | Count | When to use |
|---|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `All the best,\nLorenzo` | 929 | Default English closing |
| 2 | `Kind regards,\nLorenzo` | 421 | Formal English messages |
| 3 | `Lorenzo` | 389 | Short/quick replies |
| 4 | `Safe travels!\nLorenzo` | 307 | Post-checkout / post-stay |
| 5 | `Cordiali saluti,\nLorenzo` | ~200 | Formal Italian messages |
| 6 | `Buon viaggio!\nLorenzo` | ~100 | Italian post-checkout |
| 7 | No closing | ~600 | Quick replies, single-line answers |

### Rules
- **Quick replies** (1-2 sentences): no closing needed, or just "Lorenzo"
- **Structured messages** (check-in, checkout, welcome): always close with one of the above
- **Post-stay messages**: prefer "Safe travels!" / "Buon viaggio!"
- **Italian messages**: "Cordiali saluti" for formal, nothing for quick replies

## Problem Resolution — 5-Step Flow

Lorenzo and Donatella follow a **consistent 5-step approach** for ALL problems:

### Step 1: Acknowledge immediately
- "I'm sorry for the inconvenience" / "Mi dispiace per il disagio"
- Never ignore or dismiss, always empathetic

### Step 2: Provide self-service fix FIRST
- Send video tutorial or specific instructions
- "Check the switches on the right side of the door"
- "The boiler button is next to the bathroom mirror"

### Step 3: Offer escalation
- "If you're unable to resolve it or prefer assistance, I'd be happy to stop by this afternoon"
- "I will call the technician"

### Step 4: Follow up
- "Did you manage to solve the problem?"
- "Hi [name], did everything work out?"

### Step 5: Compensate when needed
- Proactively offer refunds for real inconveniences
- "Let me know how much you think is suitable as compensation and I will issue a refund"
- Typical: 20-50 EUR for minor issues, 100-150 EUR for major issues, one night refund for serious problems

## Troubleshooting by Category — REAL Examples

### A. ELECTRICITY / POWER OUTAGE

**Milano — Full Protocol (3+ real occurrences):**

**Real exchange (Katherine Smith, 2025):**
> Guest: "Hello -- The power just went out when we were getting ready when my mom plugged in the blow dryer"
>
> Lorenzo: "Hi Katherine, Please check the switches on the right side of the door and ensure that they are all turned up. If everything is already in the correct position, you'll need to head down to the basement to reset the circuit. Here's a quick video tutorial to guide you through the process: https://youtu.be/Th1pxWFlLuU The code to access the key is 2709. If you're unable to resolve it or prefer assistance, I'd be happy to stop by this afternoon to help. Let me know what works best for you"

**Real exchange (Ryan Vaske, 2025):**
> Guest: "Hello! The power has gone out in the apartment. Could we receive assistance to get the power back on?"
>
> Donatella: "Ok. You have to go in the cellar of the building. I will send you here a video to drive you. First, get the back up keys in the lockbox outside the apartment door (2709 is the code)"
> Donatella: "https://youtu.be/Th1pxWFlLuU"
> Donatella: "Ryan, before to go in the cellar, check is is not just the panel that you have in the apartment (right inside apart door)"

**Milano electricity protocol:**
1. Check apartment switches on RIGHT side of door — ensure all turned UP
2. If not fixed: get backup keys from lockbox outside apartment door (code 2709)
3. Go to cellar via ground floor door behind lift
4. Reset the circuit breaker
5. Video: https://youtu.be/Th1pxWFlLuU
6. Offer to come by if guest can't fix it
7. Follow up: "Did you manage to put the electricity on again?"
8. After resolved: "Please put the backup keys back in the lockbox"

**Giacinto Collegno — Power issues:**
> Guest: "No power"
>
> Donatella: "Check if the button on the left of the fridge, behind the Nespresso coffee machine is on"

**Key: Giacinto Collegno has wall switches next to the fridge that control appliance power.**

**Drovetti — Building-wide outage:**
> Guest: "Purtroppo l'assenza di elettricita ci crea abbastanza disagio"
>
> Donatella: "Si certo. Gli altri condomini hanno confermato che manca in tutto il condominio. L'amministratore sta contattando il distributore energia."
>
> Next day: "Buongiorno. L'elettricita' e' gia' tornata. Il pulsante del boiler (interno bagno sulla destra) se era in ON dovrebbe essere gia' attivo."

**Key: When area-wide, reassure it's not just their apartment. Contact building admin. Follow up when resolved.**

---

### B. AC / HEATING / CLIMATE

**AC — How to turn on (Milano):**
> Guest: "One question: how to turn on air conditioning?"
>
> Lorenzo: "Hi Zuri, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWsDkN7Zwus you can find how to turn on the ac at the 50 second mark"

**AC mode (Milano):**
> Donatella: "Prova a schiacciare MODE sul display e selezionare il simbolo del fiocco di neve."

**Heating — Central heating off at night (ALL Turin properties):**
> Guest (Jim McNiel, Drovetti): "The towel rack is cold and we can't figure out how to increase the temp."
>
> Donatella: "It's a central heating for all the building. And in Turin region have to be off from 11pm to 5am. I'm sorry. If you move the radiators valves at 4 or 5 position, you will have warm fastly early the morning."

**AC as heat pump (Giacinto Collegno):**
> Guest: "It would be great if you could let me have a small fan heater - it's cold here"
>
> Lorenzo: "Unfortunately, we don't have a fan heater available, since you can turn on the AC and set it to the 'sun' icon to heat the apartment."

> Guest: "Can I adjust the radiator because it's very cold in here. Also the AC is it only for cold air?"
>
> Donatella: "You can adjust the radiators. Probably the maid left them at zero. Just turn the knobs at 4 or 5"

**AC/Climate — Drovetti:**
> Guest: "Bonjour, nous n'arrivons pas à allumer la clim"
>
> Lorenzo sent: 1) "Hello, have you tried https://v2.hostfully.com/gwznxzs" 2) https://youtu.be/bo4tJ04uHy8

**Key patterns:**
- Turin: Central heating off 11pm-5am (building-controlled)
- ALL properties: AC doubles as heat pump (sun icon = heat)
- Radiator valves: adjust to 4 or 5
- Milano: AC instructions in check-in video at 50-second mark
- Drovetti: Link digital guide first, then video

---

### C. HOT WATER / BOILER

**Bardonecchia — Electric boiler:**
> Donatella: "L'interruttore del boiler a destra della porta del bagno deve stare su ON. Un paio di ore massimo e l'acqua calda per la doccia sara' ok. Lasciatelo pure su on per tutto il soggiorno."
>
> Lorenzo: "Una volta acceso ci vuole circa 1 ora perché ci sia acqua calda (visto che è da 80L)"

**Bardonecchia boiler key facts:**
- Electric 80L (Ariston Lydos Plus)
- Switch on RIGHT side of bathroom door
- Takes 1-2 hours to heat from cold
- Leave ON for entire stay
- 4 consecutive adult showers NOT possible

**Drovetti — Boiler switch:**
> Donatella: "Regarding the hot water: maybe you've switched off the boiler. The button is in the bathroom left side of the mirrow"
>
> Lorenzo (when switch was broken): sent technician, then updated guest: "the technician came and now the boiler works again! The physical switch is still broken and we are going to change it soon, but now the boiler has been directly connected to electricity, so it works."

**Milano — Hot water:**
> Guest self-resolved: "Ok sry our fault ;)) we saw the video but i didn't notice that's for the water"
> Video: https://youtu.be/gMiZkQbm04c

---

### D. WIFI / INTERNET

> Guest (Drovetti): reported WiFi not working
>
> Lorenzo: "Im really sorry about this inconvenience! I got off the line with the wifi provider and they are experiencing a malfunction in that area of Turin, I will let you know as soon as I know more. If you need mobile data you could use airalo. Hey, have you tried an eSIM? Get US$3 off your first eSIM data pack from Airalo. Use code LORENZ5261 when you sign up. https://ref.airalo.com/1z4y"

**WiFi pattern:**
1. Check with ISP if area-wide issue
2. Offer Airalo eSIM as backup (referral code LORENZ5261)
3. Schedule technician if hardware issue

---

### E. BUILDING EXIT (Milano)

> Guest: "how do I get out of the building?"
>
> Lorenzo: "To exit the building (without keys) there is a button in front of the elevator downstairs that opens the condominium door. You can see where it is at the end of this video: https://youtu.be/VWsDkN7Zwus"

> Lorenzo: "From inside you can open the main door with the white button in front of the elevator. To close the apartment door when you go out, just press the arrow on the keypad"

---

### F. SOFA BED

**Milano (30 EUR surcharge):**
> Guest: "is it possible to get the sofa bed made up for her"
>
> Donatella: "Just want to advice that the Mattress of this sofa is not as thick as a proper bed, but I've slept there and I've always found it comfortable. If you'd like us to prepare it, we'll charge 30 extra."
>
> Lorenzo: "I send you a video to open the sofa bed, that is already prepared. https://youtu.be/BLICzW5BnLU"
> Later: "This video is how to close it https://youtu.be/BR-SsjCgqCY"

**Drovetti (20 EUR surcharge):**
